h2. What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that use artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data. Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, these networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each layer processes input data and passes it to the next, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and representations.

The "deep" in deep learning refers to the number of hidden layers in the network, which can range from a few to hundreds. These layers allow the model to learn hierarchical featureízo

h2. What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers to model complex patterns and representations from large datasets. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, these networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers: an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer transforms the input data, extracting increasingly abstract features, which enables deep learning models to tackle tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing with remarkable accuracy.

Unlike traditional machine learning, which often requires manual feature engineering, deep learning automatically learns features directly from raw data. This capability, combined with advancements in computational power (e.g., GPUs and TPUs) and the availability of massive datasets, has driven breakthroughs in fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.

h3. Key Components of Deep Learning

* *Neurons*: The basic computational units that receive inputs, apply weights, add biases, and pass the result through an activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh) to produce an output.
* *Layers*: Collections of neurons that process data simultaneously. Deep networks have many hidden layers, enabling complex feature extraction.
* *Weights and Biases*: Adjustable parameters that the network learns during training to minimize the error in predictions.
* *Activation Functions*: Introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to model complex relationships.
* *Loss Function*: Measures the difference between predicted and actual outputs, guiding the optimization process.
* *Backpropagation*: An algorithm that computes gradients of the loss function and updates weights using optimization techniques like gradient descent or its variants (e.g., Adam).
* *Training Data*: Large datasets used to adjust the network’s parameters through iterative optimization.

h3. Why Deep Learning?

Deep learning excels in tasks where traditional methods struggle, such as:
* *High-Dimensional Data*: Handling raw images, audio, or text without extensive preprocessing.
* *Non-Linear Relationships*: Capturing complex patterns in data.

However, deep learning has challenges:
* *Computational Cost*: Requires significant processing power and time.
* *Data Dependency*: Needs large amounts of labeled data for training.
